This project is a basic website built with HTML and CSS.
It includes:

A header with the store logo and title

A description of the products and services offered

A list of categories sold by the store

A Google Maps embed showing the store location

A table with team members

A footer with social media links and a promotional video

The website structure is simple and uses only one HTML file (index.html) and one CSS file (estilos.css). There is no JavaScript or external frameworks.
